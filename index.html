        Welcome to my website! My name is Alex Warfield. I was born in Anaheim, California on October 16th, 1992. I graduated from high school in 2010, went to a community college for 2 years, and transferred to a university to get my degree in psychology. Throughout the years, I've worked at some interesting jobs that have shaped my life. The first job I worked at was at a Mental Health Clinic where I helped set up community events to teach the public the importance of mental health issues. Working there really helped build my public relations skills. The next job I worked at was as an intern for a Non-profit Political Organization. I did a lot of canvasing to pass bills to disclose which businesses and parties are backing certain political issues. I had to do a lot of signature gathering and cold-calling which helped me a lot in getting out of my shell and talking to people. After that, I worked as an Administrative Assistant at an Online School for Civil Engineering where I managed the school's remote livestream system, made updates to the front-end of their website, and other IT duties. After working at the Engineering school, I ended up switching my career focus to computer science because I enjoyed it so much. And since then, I've begun my journey to become a web developer.

        The purpose of this website is to document my journey to becoming a web developer and to help and guide those who are following the same path. I will be regularly updating this website with blog posts of my progress in learning the ins and outs of web development and providing my audience with insight on the job hunting process. I am going into this with an almost clean slate (besides the limited exposure to HTML I had in my last job), so most everything will be new to me and we can follow at the same pace. Within the homepage, I will provide links to my blog posts, helpful websites and resources, and my contact information to ask me any questions. At the bottom of the page I will provide a form to sign up for my newsletter so you can stay updated on the progress of the site. I hope by the end of this endeavor I will have become proficient in my field and will have made a lasting impact on my readers. Thank you for taking this journey with me and good luck!

      <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>

        A couple weeks ago I took my first step in my web development career through joining Correlation One, a coding bootcamp created by Amazon. I was nervous at first because I barely had any experience with computer languages, but the courses have been very beginner-friendly and easy to follow. The instructors are also very good at explaining things step-by-step. On the first day, we covered the basics of how the internet works and how data is transported all around the world. After that, we delved straight into HTML. We learned how to implement Paragraphs, Links, Media, and Forms into a website. The user-interface for the classes provides us with a window to test our code during the lecture making it feel very hands-on. Within each lecture, we were assigned exercises that we needed to complete by the next lecture. These included making data submission forms, websites with images, videos, and music, and replications of webpages. Overall, the experience has been very valuable and I look forward to what's to come.
